- Open a directory in vs code
- Create a file with `.py` extension
- Write code
- Open Vs code terminal, go to the directory where your python file is present
- Type `python file_name.py` to run your file. (For linux and mac users `python3 file_name.py`)
- For running without typing commands, we can download vs code python extensions.
