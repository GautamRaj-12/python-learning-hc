- **Exiting from Python Shell/Terminal**

- **About this shell**
  - In this shell, we can directly write python code but it won't be saved.
  - For example: Type `print("Hello")` and press enter. Hello will be printed immediately.
  - We can do basic calculations here also.

  - But it is not really made for calculating. It is used to test a piece of python code quickly without creating any file.
  - Suppose, I want to see what happens when I multiply a string by any number. Instead of going through the process of creating -> saving -> running a file. I can directly test here.

- **Variables in shell**
  - Type `score=100` in the shell and press enter. There won't be any output, as we have just stored a value.
  - To print the value type `score`

  - Try to print a variable that hasn't been defined. Such as `place`. It will give an error.
